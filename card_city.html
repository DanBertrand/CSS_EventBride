	    		<p class="city-card-text">The fall of the Berlin Wall was not only a political revolution but the start of a cultural awakening that reverberated from German clubs around the world. Now, Berlin's iconic club scene aims to get UNESCO recognition.</p>
	    		<p class="city-card-text">"After the Wall came down it was a process of coming back together as one," says Dr. Motte, DJ and founder of the Love Parade, about the creation of a "new culture" on the dance floors of reunified Berlin.
				It was July 1989 when Dr. Motte put on the first Love Parade, a techno music and dance festival on West Berlin's Ku'damm high street that was registered as a demonstration for "Peace, Joy and Pancakes." At the time, he and the 150 people who danced through the city had no idea that the Wall would soon fall — nor that an incipient electronic music scene would draw millions to the streets of reunified Berlin.
				Speaking near his studio in Berlin's Wedding district three decades later, Motte remembers how quickly the city came together in the acid-house infused underground in 1989. On Thursday November 9, the night the Wall fell, East German devotees of club music that they could only hear on West Berlin radio crossed the border and packed into the Ufo, a renowned Kreuzberg club. As both sides of the city danced together that night, an inclusive club movement would continue to break down barriers, to "dance for a better world," as Dr. Motte puts it.</p>

	    		<p class="city-card-text">All evenings can be long in Porto, but one is definitely longer than the rest: the evening of São João.
				You can’t go wrong: if you’re in town and someone out of nowhere hits you on the head with a plastic hammer, then you’ll know it’s party time! It takes place every year on the evening of 23 June to the 24th. Although the festivity is Catholic (celebrating the birth of Saint John the Baptist), it has strong pagan traditions and, therefore, is celebrated by everyone alike.
				It is all about tradition: you have the more modern martelinhos (thousands of people join in the party with little plastic hammers), and the age-old tradition; the fireworks near the River Douro, uniting Porto and Gaia, and the democratic sardine barbecues at every street corner in town.
				As if that weren’t enough, there are dozens of folk dances all over town. Note this down: Fontainhas and Miragaia are the favourite ones, so get there early if you want a front-row view.
				The fit party-goers walk the marine parade along the River Douro from Ribeira to Foz do Douro, to watch the sunrise on the beach. You can rest on the 24th as it’s a well-deserved municipal holiday.</p>
